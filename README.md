# -E-MWM-Style
# EMwm / Mwm window manager style. Mwm is the Motif Windows Manager.

EMwm is a lightweight window manager for X11. It is derived from Mwm, adding
support for UTF-8 / Xft , Xinerama and Extended Window Manager Hints. EMwm is made by alx210 
who is also a contributor of the CDE (common desktop environment) project. 

These configuration files are inspired by the HP-UX workstations look and CDE (Common Desktop Manager)
based on the Motif toolkit. 

You have to rename and use one of these files, depending on what windows manager you're running
as your ~/.Xresources or ~/.Xdefaults config file.

This program allows you to create a menu from Freedesktop (freedesktop.org) desktop entry files
and to include this menu in your .mwmrc or .emwmrc config/menu file.
